# Mulch

Mulch is a tool for generating a cedar receipt from a cf space state.
This is useful when adding additional apps to an existing space that was pushed
with [cedar](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-stress-tests/tree/master/cedar).

## Usage

```bash
mulch -o <outputFile>
```

### -o <path-to-output-file>
Optional flag to specify output file.
